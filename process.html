                <h2>Call for Stories</h2>
                <div> The LeTS team sends out a call for original stories from workshop participants</div>
                <div><img src="./assets/img/process-call-for-stories.jpg" alt="" srcset=""></div>
                <div> We select stories that lend themselves to visual storytelling </div>
                <div class="spacer"></div>
                <h2>LeTS Workshop (4-5 days)</h2>
                <div>There are as many variants in this part of the workshop as there have been workshops! They
                    have most of the following elements in common. </div>
                <div>Form groups for story telling</div>
                <div>Teach storyboarding (how do you tell a story in images)</div>
                <div>
                    <p>select key frames and explore illustration techniques. </p>
                    <p>
                        past workshops have experimented with pencil and poster paints, and with using found materials like
                        grass,
                        leaves and rocks to create forms, which often became the protagonsists of the stories
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        teach page design and word-image relationships, and ideas of balance, filled vs empty space
                        Each student typically illustrates one sentence or one page keeping context in mind
                    </p>

                <h2>Back At LeTS</h2>
                <div>
                    Instructors bring scanned images back to the studio for cleanup and artwork refinement.
                </div>
                <div>
                    The LeTS team translates the books into English and place text on cleaned illustrations on the pages
                    that
                    were
                    scanned prior to writing text.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Select choice of paper and binding. Earlier experiements with binding have included accordion-style and
                    map-style folds, in addition to traditional methods. The books are printed on heavy paper with vibrant
                    colours.
                </div>
                <div>Invite a voiceover artist to read and record the story. Several well-known professional
                    voice-over artists have
                    lent their voice to our narrations.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Add a "fingerprint" of each page of the book, along with the corresponding voice-over for each page to
                    the
                    mobile app. We don't want the image to appear on a screen. Instead, we like the book to be part of the
                    experience of listening to the story, so the mobile phone camera is made to point to the printed page,
                    and
                    the
                    app instantly recognizes the appropriate LeTS book and the correct page, based on recognizing the
                    essential
                    fingerprint features of the image. This works even when parts of the book are occluded by a child's
                    hands,
                    and
                    across a wide range of lighting.
                </div>
                <div>Create animated shorts of the story with voiceover, music and highlighted captions. Very few
                    books are selected
                    for this stage, for it is a most time-consuming activity.
                </div>
                <div>We measure proficiency levels by recording children reading the story from subtitles. Much of
                    the learning here
                    is meta-learning and not quantifiable, such the boost of confidence in seeing a high-quality end-result
                    of
                    one's
                    labours, the newly acquired belief that one's stories are of interest to others
                </div>
                <div class="spacer"></div>
                <h2>Dissemination</h2>
                <div>
                    Send copies back to library of partner school where the workshop was held, and copies to other schools
                    that
                    have
                    partnered with LeTS. The intent is to foster an exchange of such boooks between schools and libraries on
                    an
                    ongoing basis. A book written in village Aina in Maharashtra is enjoyed by a school in Himachal Pradesh.
                    We
                    are
                    giddy
                    about such cross-pollination!
