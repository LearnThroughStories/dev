    <h2> About LeTS </h2>
    <div class="about">
      <p>
        The Learn Through Stories (LeTS) initiative reinforces the role of children as content creators rather than mere
        consumers, and enables them to learn about language, environment, culture, history and more, using storytelling
        and
        art as learning pedagogies.
      </p>
      <p>The LeTS approach</p>

      <ul>
        <li>gives a voice, identity, and a platform to the child's imagination</li>
        <li>
          brings in confidence with the collaborative effort between the child and professional designers, animators,
          picture book artists and illustrators
        </li>
        <li>is curated and tested by a team from IIT Bombay across schools in India</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In collaboration with IIT Bombay, the Learn Through Stories (LeTS) Foundation aims to disseminate this alternate
        approach to learning - LeTS - by conducting content creation workshops and collecting contextual stories from
        schools in India, both rural and urban, to foster content co-creation, teach book design and production, and
        publish
        books that return to all students and teachers. Our products include a curated process of content creation,
        physical
        story books, and their digital parallels in the form of animation films and interactive applications. Our sole
        objective is to maximise social impact in the field of learning and education across India.
      </p>

      We, Alka Hingorani, Arti Kalro and Gayathri Thakoor, form the core team at Learn Through Stories (LeTS)
      Foundation.
