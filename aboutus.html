    <h2> About LeTS </h2>
    <div class="about">
      <p>
        The Learn Through Stories Foundation helps students learn through content that they themselves helped produce.
        Our
        primary objective is to maximise social impact in the field of education across India.
      </p>

      <p>
        But, first, a little context. In 2014, Prof. Alka Hingorani of IIT Bombay started the “Learn English Through
        Stories” (LETS) project to address two fundamental problems – in remote villages in India, not only is the
        language unfamiliar and seldom heard, but the pedagogies are themselves rooted in urban/Western contexts, too
        alien to the land. On the other hand, when encouraged and trained to tell and draw their own favourite stories,
        students tended to be immensely animated and engaged. And when these stories were turned into illustrated books
        and translated into English, the newness of the language was the only bridge to cross.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through several years of LETS, we came to realize that language wasn’t the only thing they were learning. In
        collaborating with each other, with professional designers and artists, and sharing authorship credit, in
        writing
        themselves into the material from which they learn, we had flipped the script: learners were becoming teachers,
        and consumers, creators of content. The further realization that the process is subject-agnostic helped us knock
        the ‘E’ down to ‘e’ – we are now Learn Through Stories (LeTS).
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2020, Gayathri Thakoor and Prof. Arti Kalro, who had long been friends of the project, became instrumental in
        starting the Learn Through Stories Foundation (a not-for-profit endeavour) to take the project out of its
        research
        confines and into the wider world. Meanwhile, research continues apace at IIT Bombay.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, the LeTS Foundation conducts content-creation workshops, collects contextual stories from schools in
        India,
        both rural and urban, teaches book design and production, and publishes books that then return to all students
        and
        teachers. Our work involves a team of designers and includes a curated process, physical story books, and their
        digital parallels in animation films and interactive applications.
      </p>

      <p>We gratefully acknowledge the generous support from the Tata Centre for Technology and Design at IIT Bombay.

          <strong>Gayathri Thakoor</strong> is co-founder and CEO of Learn Through Stories (LeTS) Foundation. A
          published author,
          manager, and entrepreneur over a career graph of 25 years, her role as a news journalist sharing stories
          formed the base of it all. She then co-founded a business enterprise to develop literature for children, and
          create animated characters that were copyrighted to feature in illustrated picture books and in the digital
          medium to sell on the international app store. Gayathri’s experience as General Manager - Programs with Tata
          Centre for Technology and Design, at IIT Bombay, brought her in closeness with the Learn English Through
          Stories project – the genesis of this social enterprise. Taking the best out of her experiences, she believes
          collaboration is key. For better and more. Her blog - Affectionately G – helps her keep in touch with readers
          through diary entries and letters. Gayathri holds two postgraduate degrees in Education and in Business
          Administration, and a graduate degree in Economics.

          <strong>Arti Kalro</strong> is faculty in the Shailesh J Mehta School of Management at IIT Bombay. Her areas
          of expertise
          include Marketing and Social Innovations. While designing and teaching the course, Technology and Design for
          End-to-End Innovations for resource-constrained communities, she continued to grow her interest in helping
          Alka in translating and taking her dream of the LeTS' vision to the market. And here she is now, along with
          Gayathri & Alka, trying to take LeTS to every child in India. When Arti isn’t teaching or racking her brain on
          scaling-up LeTS, she is busy (and immensely happy) spending time with children, getting their hands dirty with
          paint and clay.
