        <p>The LeTS (Learn Through Stories) project is an initiative of IDC School of Design, IIT Bombay.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            It is a collaboration between illustrators, authors, animators. Some are younger than
            fifteen, others are design professionals. The kids are from village schools of India, and not always exposed
            to
            English-oriented education.
          </strong>
        </p>
        We invite them to narrate stories in their own language that they have heard growing up. We teach them to
        storyboard and illustrate select stories. These stories are translated by us into English and converted into
        gorgeously produced books, animated films, and mobile apps.

        <!-- Children, teachers and the LeTS team engage in an open exchange of ideas, explore newer
        ways and kinds of learning through stories, and learn to collaboratively create both
        content and books. The circle is complete when schools exchange their books with others. -->
        When the printed books reach the school libraries, the kids are already intimately familiar with the
        story, narrative and illustration. The English translation is the only newness. So it is
        that they learn from content that they themselves create!

          Kids love these books. The rich, thick paper, the saturated colours, and the
          stories that seem both strange and familiar, are <emph>theirs</emph>. It is their names on the book jacket
          and crowding the credits page.
        </p>

        <p>Their eyes and minds become sensitized to quality production of their own work, so it is not just words,
          but worlds they can create anew.</p>
