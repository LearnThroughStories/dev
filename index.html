        <div><p>The LeTS project is a collaboration between illustrators, authors, animators. 
            Some of them are younger than fifteen, others are design professionals. 
            The kids are from village schools of India not exposed to English-oriented education. </b><br><br><br>
  
            <small>This is how we help them learn English: We teach children to illustrate and narrate stories that they have 
              heard growing up, in their own language. We convert them into gorgeously produced books in English 
              and animated films. For the children, the only new element of learning is the English translation; 
              they are intimately familiar with the rest of the material already. The meta-learning is important 
              too. The children (and their schools) learn to shoot for, and to expect high quality. 
              Exchanging their books with other schools gives them pride of ownership and pleasure of sharing.</p>
